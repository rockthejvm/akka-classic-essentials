# The official repository for the Rock the JVM! Akka Essentials with Scala course

This repository contains the code we wrote during  [Rock the JVM's Akka Essentials with Scala](https://www.udemy.com/akka-essentials) course on Udemy. Unless explicitly mentioned, the code in this repository is exactly what was caught on camera.

How to install:
- either clone the repo or download as zip
- open with IntelliJ as an SBT project

No need to do anything else, as the IDE will take care to download and apply the appropriate library dependencies.

If you have changes to suggest to this repo, either
- submit a GitHub issue
- tell me in the course Q/A forum
- submit a pull request!
